#### Music Sequencer Mixed Reality Software made for VTHACKS 2019

This application is a mixed reality utility designed for the Microsoft HoloLens. It allows users to manipulate sounds and its individual beats for an easy experience of creating music. The sounds are consisted of guitar, piano, drums, bass, and user customized sounds that can be recorded inside the application through the HoloLens built-in microphone.

This project was born from an interest in virtual, augmented, and mixed reality systems, as well as a passion for music. Digital music sequencers are a great way for amateurs and hobbyists to pursue their creative interests, as well as for children and teenagers to explore music techonology. The goal of this project was to make a tool that would allow a user to be completely immersed in the music creation process, while also allowing for the exploration of mixed reality spaces.

## Hardware

The system was built to be used with the [Microsoft HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/), taking advantage of the onboard computer to allow users to make music anywhere, using the intuitive hand controls of the HoloLens. The music sequencer can also be used with other mixed reality systems including the [Window's Mixed Reality Headset](https://www8.hp.com/us/en/campaigns/mixedrealityheadset/overview.html).

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to VT Hacks for the chance to make this project.

Thank you to Microsoft for the opportunity to use their SDK and hardware!

## IMPORTANT

Since the file size of the entire build was too big, we were unable to upload the nesscessary files to run the program. So, we included only the files needed to show the effort and the basics of functionality. All of the scripts and models in this Git are custom made by us.
